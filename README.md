Anabel provides a visual bridge to the command "composer outdated", in order to review the status of the packages you're using in your project.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require driade/anabel
```

## Usage

You may display Anabel results, usually, in a route under the admin area of your site. Just add this lines to your controller and you should see the results.

```php
$anabel = new \Driade\Anabel\Anabel;

$anabel->setConfig(['all' => true, 'composer_dir' => __DIR__, 'sort' => true]);
$anabel->outdated();

echo $anabel->render();
```

Anabel will display the output in HTML using Bootstrap.

## Configuration

You can pass an array to setConfig in order to control the behaviour of the package. These are the available options:

```php
[
    'all'             => false, // Whether to show all the packages or just which should need an update
    'composer_dir'    => '.', // Directory where the file composer.json is located
    'templates_dir'   => __DIR__ . '/views', // Directory where the templates for the output are located
    'template_header' => 'header.twig.php', // Header of the page, supports Twig
    'template_body'   => 'body.twig.php', // Body of the page, supports Twig
    'template_footer' => 'footer.twig.php', // Footer of the page, supports Twig
    'sort'            => true, // Whether to sort the packages by the need of an update
];
```

## Memory issues

This program runs in the browser and calls Composer via API, and it's possible that you have a low memory limit in your php.ini that will make Composer fail.
