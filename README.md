With this package you can define a set of data with arrays in PHP and get its representation as Eloquent models.

It's made for Laravel Illuminate\Database, so you can plug it in your Laravel projects and also in whichever project depending on Illuminate\Database, outside Laravel Framework.

Here it's and example definition:

```php
<?php

// fixtures/fixture1.php

namespace Driade\Fixtures\Test\Models;

return [
    User::class,
    'id'        => 1,
    'active'    => 1,
    'confirmed' => 1,
    'orders'    => [
        [
            Order::class,
            'id'        => 1,
            'total'     => 1,
            'shipped'   => 0,
        ],
        [
            Order::class,
            'id'        => 2,
            'total'     => 1,
            'shipped'   => 1,
        ],
    ],
];

```

you can load this definition in with

```php
$user = FixtureLoader::load(__DIR__ . '/fixtures/fixture1.php');
```

$user will have then (simplified)

```
Driade\Fixtures\Test\Models\User Object
(
    [attributes:protected] => Array
    (
        [id] => 1
        [active] => 1
        [confirmed] => 1
    )

    [relations:protected] => Array
    (
        [orders] => Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection Object
        (
            [items:protected] => Array
            (
                [0] => Driade\Fixtures\Test\Models\Order Object
                (
                    [attributes:protected] => Array
                    (
                        [id] => 1
                        [user_id] => 1
                        [total] => 1
                        [shipped] => 0
                    )
                )

                [1] => Driade\Fixtures\Test\Models\Order Object
                (
                    [attributes:protected] => Array
                    (
                        [id] => 2
                        [user_id] => 1
                        [total] => 1
                        [shipped] => 1
                    )
                )
            )
        )
